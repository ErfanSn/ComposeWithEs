# Composable Screens
A project designed to demonstrate that even the most impressive user interface designs can seamlessly be brought to life by Android developers using the Compose UI Toolkit. The project is organized into various predefined [categories](/category).

## 🎯 Goal & Result
Many eye-catching designs showcased on portfolio sites like [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/) and [Behance](https://www.behance.net/) often never make it into real-world applications. This project aims to change that by showcasing how Compose can be used to build sophisticated and visually stunning interfaces without compromise.

I have also explored a more efficient workflow for converting designs into code. As a result, I’ve created this [recipe](https://github.com/erfansn/DesignToComposeRecipe) to help streamline the process.

## 🤝 Contribute
To encourage collaboration, I’ve structured the project to reduce friction by automating key tasks and minimizing conflicts, such as the automatic creation and wiring of modules. (Learn more about this [here](/auto-nav-graph-wiring-processors).)

The success of this project depends on your contributions. If you’re interested in participating, please make sure to review the [contribution guidelines](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before getting started.

## 📂 Project Structure
To simplify the workflow, the project uses a single module and category for drawing the navigation graph.

## 📸 Instagram Page of the Project
Designs that are successfully converted into code and integrated into the project will be showcased on the project's dedicated Instagram page. This offers increased visibility and recognition for your work, while also serving as an excellent portfolio addition to highlight your skills.

## 🎥 Behind the Scenes
Partway through the project, I decided to document the journey and share insights on YouTube. If you’re curious about how I prepared the project for collaboration, check out the **Composable Screens** video series on my YouTube channel. (Note: The videos are in Persian.)
